# Binary Search (BS):

Type: Algorithm
Use: Used for searching a specific value in a SORTED list or array.
Principle: Divide and Conquer
Note: The list/array MUST BE SORTED for binary search to work.


# Binary Search Tree (BST):

Type: Data Structure
Use: Used to maintain SORTED data and supports insertion, deletion, and search operations.
Principle: Each node has a value. All the nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node,
and all the nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node.
